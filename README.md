## Description

The Vehicle Pricing project is a data-driven application designed to analyze and visualize vehicle pricing trends. Using real-world vehicle data, this project helps users understand the distribution of prices across different categories, such as fuel type, brand, and vehicle type. The project includes interactive visualizations to make the insights more intuitive and accessible.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring vehicle pricing data and presenting it using various data visualization techniques. It aims to assist potential buyers, dealers, and analysts in making informed decisions by providing a clear representation of price patterns and distributions. The project uses Python for data handling, analysis, and visualization.

## Concepts Included

The coding in this project covers several key concepts in data analysis and visualization:

1. **Data Handling with Pandas**

   * The dataset is loaded and managed using the Pandas library.
   * Features such as vehicle brand, type, mileage, and price are cleaned and prepared for analysis.

2. **Bar Graphs**

   * Bar graphs are used to compare categorical data, such as the average price of vehicles by brand or type.
   * They help identify which brands or vehicle types are more expensive or affordable.

3. **Histograms**

   * Histograms display the distribution of vehicle prices, showing how prices are spread across different ranges.
   * This helps in understanding price clusters and identifying outliers.

4. **Pie Charts**

   * Pie charts represent the proportion of vehicles by categories like fuel type or body type.
   * They provide a quick visual summary of the dataset composition.

5. **Regression Analysis (Optional)**

   * Regression can be applied to predict vehicle prices based on features like mileage, age, and brand.
   * This helps in estimating market value and spotting pricing trends.

## How to Use

1. Load the dataset using Python and Pandas.
2. Run the visualization scripts to generate bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts.
3. Analyze the charts to gain insights into vehicle pricing patterns.

## Tools & Libraries

* **Python** – Main programming language.
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For creating bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts.
* **Scikit-learn (Optional)** – For regression analysis and predictions.
